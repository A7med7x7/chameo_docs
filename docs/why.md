# Why Chameo?
> Reproducibility remains a major ML challenge; strong infrastructure and disciplined practices make it achievable.


## **Reproducibility** 
Reproducibility in Machine Learning means being able to reproduce the results of an experiment using the same code, with the same data and environment, and obtain the same results.  
in research, this remains a **significant problem**, many papers lack proper experiment tracking, dependency capturing, versioning, and artifact sharing. As a result, even the original authors often struggle to reproduce their own results several months later.

this weakens trust and slows scientific progress, since others cannot easily validate or build upon previous work.  
in production, however, **MLOps practices** (automation, versioning, monitoring) have proven to be key enablers of reproducible and trustworthy ML systems. 
but for researchers, **adapting these tools and practices is full of friction**; stitching everything together takes considerable time
and effort.  

## **Chameo removes this barrier** 
Chameo help you by providing ready-to-use templates with reproducibility baked in, so you can focus on spinning up your VMs instead of infrastructure.

## **Supporting Reproducibility with Chameo**:  
- It makes it easier for researchers and scientists to adopt MLOps practices in their projects.  
- It provides ready-to-launch templates with reproducibility baked in (experiment tracking, consistent environments, artifact persistence).  
- It lowers the barrier to reproducible research on platforms like **Chameleon Cloud**.
